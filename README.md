# PSL-KGE

An integration of embedding techniques into Probablistic Soft Logic (PSL). Traditionally, PSL does not natively handle such an integration, and therefore this project aims to treat embedding dimensions as latent features and creating rules describing the relations between each dimension.

# Data

We use FB15k and WN18 which is published in "Translating Embeddings for Modeling Multi-relational Data (2013)." by Bordes et al. [link](https://www.hds.utc.fr/everest/doku.php?id=en:transe)
